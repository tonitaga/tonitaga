## Preamble

![MyBio](/images/1.png)

Somewhere near the coffee machine at the end of 2021:

*-- Hey, you really enjoy programming, have you ever thought about taking some courses?*

*- Yes, I do, but I don't even know where to learn programming.*

*-- Well, there's a programming school in our city called "School 21".*

*- Oh, right, how could I forget about that? I'll start gathering my documents and prepare for the selection process.*

*-- Good luck!*

A couple of months later:

*- Hey, I feel so scared and uncomfortable because I'm a complete beginner in programming.*

*-- Don't worry, everyone starts from scratch, we'll get through it!*

*- Today was the first day, turns out there are no teachers there, and the learning is based on a peer-to-peer system.*

*-- Wow, what's that?*

*- It means that the learning is based on the idea of mass collaboration combined with close interaction with other participants.*

After a month of diligent completion of the selection stage:

*-- I received an email today, it says that I've been accepted for the main training program.*

*- Congratulations! When does the main training start?*

*-- It starts closer to the end of April 2022.*

## About me

Hello everyone! My name is Nurislam Gubaydullin. I am a passionate developer with more than two years of IT experience.

In 2022, I entered School 21, where my path in programming began. During this time I have managed to implement more than 10 pet projects. One of the most interesting experiences was participating in open-source: I contributed to the [microsoft/v—Åpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) repository, which gave me valuable experience working with real projects.

Besides programming, I find pleasure in assembling a Rubik's cube and playing the guitar. It allows me to take my mind off the routine and find new ideas. I like to play computer games. In my work and life, I try to approach everything responsibly and with attention to detail. It is important for me not only to complete tasks, but also to constantly develop, learn new things and
share knowledge with others.

I'm fond of writing articles on habr, but I haven't had time for that lately.
